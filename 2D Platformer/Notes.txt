1. for ui use margin container over control
2. always use size flags in ui for allignment
3. emit_signal() can be connected by instancing scene or autoload
4. use get_tree.get_nodes_in_group(group_name) returns array
5. edit transition in animation_player is very useful for switching 
animations automatically when one completed
6. Always handle game_state(dying, respawn) in Level script
7. Prefer using signals more than groups, use groups when you
scene in tree are unknown
8. Use autoload only for level_switching, screen_transition stuff
like called by more scripts for easy accessing
9. autoload a scene node instead script, a scene autoload can be
called easily by $"/root/scene_name"
10. Don't ever use reload_current_scene(),
instead do change_scene(same_index) we also get transition effect
11. Atlas texture in texture dropdown 
used for cropping images from sprite-sheet
12. Animated Texture in texture dropdown used for animating 
loop animations in ui
13. Always use area2d to area2d collisons and use kinematic body only for terrain
or other body collisions
14. Don't add audio_stream_player.play() in script, try to call it in animation player 
itself.
15. Make sure to "make unique" whenever duplicating .tres file and make changes or it'll collapse
